# Stool
! Imagine having an app that treats an investor with 1k 
equally to an investor with 1lakh, where you can 
invest money without any knowledge and without 
the help of any broker.

My team presenting you with a project **Stool** to make 
our life easier

A plan to invest in a stock via group pool. Friends come
together to invest in stocks and cryptocurrency, for 
sharing the investment strategy and profit. 

*Invest Together Grow Together.*




## How it Works ?

Here you can join a group of investors, who together invest
in a stock, fix a deadline to withdraw the amount, you can 
request admin to add new stock in a group.

Or you can create your unique group and  add different stocks in
it, and ask other users to join you and invest with you, where
you can share ideas with each other and can grow together.
